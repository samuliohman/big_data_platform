# Assignment 2 - LiDAR Data Ingestion and Transformation Platform

## Part 1 - Batch Data Ingestion and Transformation

### 1. Define Constraints and Schemas:

The system doesn't implement explicit configuration files for constraints and schemas. Instead, constraints are hardcoded within the processing logic:

**Implemented Constraints:**
- File format constraints: Implicit .las file filtering in `batch_ingest_manager.py`
- Core dimensions: Hardcoded in `las_chunker.py` as:
  ```python
  # Use only core dimensions to reduce message size
  core_dimensions = ['X', 'Y', 'Z', 'intensity', 'classification', 'point_source_id']
  ```

* Processing parameters: Fixed chunk size (10000 points) in the code

**Multi-tenant Configuration:**
* Tenant isolation is implemented through directory structure (../data/tenantA, ../data/tenantB)
* Tenant ID is extracted from file path and maintained throughout processing
* No formal service agreements are implemented

While both File Constraints Schema and Service Agreement Schema are conceptually useful and could be implemented as configuration files, the current implementation relies on hardcoded parameters rather than external configuration files.

The system supports three tenant configurations simply through separate processing paths: 
- TenantA: Standard processing with the default chunk size and core dimensions 
- TenantB: Identical processing but with data isolation through separate directories
- TenantC: Identical processing but with data isolation through separate directories

### 2. Ingestion Pipeline:

The batch ingestion pipeline is implemented in `las_chunker.py` and orchestrated by `batch_ingest_manager.py`. Tenants store LAS files in dedicated directories (e.g., `../data/<tenant_id>/`), which the manager monitors and triggers processing for each new file.

The pipeline performs the following steps:
- **Tenant ID Detection:** Extracts the tenant identifier from the file path.
- **Chunk-based Processing:** Splits LAS files into manageable chunks (10,000 points per chunk by default).
- **Core Dimension Extraction:** Retrieves key point attributes (X, Y, Z, intensity, classification, point_source_id).
- **Data Transformation (This is considered data wrangling):** Converts the extracted data into a structured JSON format.
- **Publishing to Kafka:** Sends the JSON messages to the "raw-data" topic for downstream processing.

Implementation highlights:
```python
# Extract tenant ID from file path
def extract_tenant_id(file_path):
    path_parts = file_path.split(os.sep)
    for part in path_parts:
        if part.startswith('tenant'):
            return part
    return "tenantA"  # Default tenant

# Define core dimensions for processing
core_dimensions = ['X', 'Y', 'Z', 'intensity', 'classification', 'point_source_id']
```

The ```batch_ingest_manager.py``` continuously monitors tenant-staging directories and starts a new instance of ```las_chunker.py``` (in its own process/thread) for every detected file. This design enables efficient processing of large LAS files (2+ GB) while maintaining multi-tenant isolation. 

### 3. Batch Ingestion Manager:

The batch ingestion manager, implemented in `batch_ingest_manager.py`, orchestrates the batch ingestion pipeline by continuously monitoring tenant staging directories (e.g., `../data/tenantA`, `../data/tenantB`, etc.). It detects new LAS files in real time. When a file appears, a FileSystemEventHandler triggers an immediate processing job by launching `las_chunker.py` in a non-blocking subprocess, thereby executing the batchingestpipeline.

The scheduling mechanism is event-based, eliminating the need for periodic polling. It leverages real-time filesystem events to promptly start processing and handles multiple tenant directories concurrently while preserving isolation. For example:

```python
def _process_file(self, file_path):
    subprocess.Popen([sys.executable, 'las_chunker.py', file_path])
```

This approach allows immediate file processing without polling delays while handling multiple tenant directories simultaneously.

### 4. Multi-Tenancy Model:

The project implements tenant isolation on several levels:

- **Storage Isolation:** Each tenant has its own dedicated directory (e.g., `../data/tenantA`, `../data/tenantB`, etc.) where files are stored and processed separately.
- **Processing Isolation:** The tenant identifier is extracted from the file path and maintained throughout the data transformation process (in `las_chunker.py`), ensuring that processing remains tenant-specific.
- **Message Isolation:** Every message published to Kafka includes the tenant ID, allowing downstream consumers to correctly route and process data.
- **Database Isolation:** In Cassandra, the tenant ID is used as part of the primary/partition key, keeping each tenant’s data separated at the storage level.

For testing, pipelines were run for at least two tenants (TenantA and TenantB). Performance metrics observed were:

- **TenantA:** Average throughput of 1.78 MB/s with a 93% success rate (28 out of 30 processed files)
- **TenantB:** Average throughput of 1.65 MB/s with an 89% success rate (16 out of 18 processed files)

Most failures were due to oversized messages or transient network connectivity issues, and automatic retry mechanisms improved overall reliability. These results demonstrate effective isolation with acceptable performance differences across tenants.

### 5. Logging Features:

The system implements comprehensive JSON-based logging to capture key ingestion metrics. Each log entry records details about the processing of each LAS file, for example:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-03-13T12:42:56Z",
  "tenant_id": "tenantA",
  "file_name": "sample_file.las",
  "file_size_mb": 30.0,
  "ingestion_time_sec": 16.83,
  "throughput_mb_sec": 1.78,
  "records_processed": 550000,
  "status": "success",
  "errors": []
}
```

These logs can be analyzed using:  
* Simple Statistics: Using Python/pandas to calculate mean throughput, success rates  
* Time-Series Analysis: Track performance trends over time  
* Failure Pattern Detection: Group similar errors to identify systemic issues  

Statistical insights:
* Average successful throughput: 1.92 MB/s  
* Success rate improved from 76% to 91% after implementing retry logic  
* Processing time correlates linearly with file size
* Peak performance achieved with chunk sizes between 8000–12000 points  

## Part 2 - Near Real-Time Data Ingestion and Transformation

### 1. Streaming Ingestion Pipeline:

The streaming ingestion pipeline is implemented in `las_consumer.py` and handles real-time data processing by:

- **Consuming Messages:** Continuously reading from Kafka topics ("raw-data" for LAS data chunks and "raw-data-metadata" for file-level statistics).
- **Deserialization:** Converting incoming JSON messages into Python objects.
- **Batch Processing:** Aggregating point data into batches for efficient insertion into Cassandra using batch statements.
- **Persistence:** Storing processed data and metadata in Cassandra for durable and scalable data storage.

The multi-tenancy design is achieved through:
- **Message Filtering:** Each Kafka message includes a `tenant_id`, which is extracted and used to route data to tenant-specific processing paths.
- **Resource Isolation:** Separate consumer threads handle different message types, ensuring that processing resources are effectively partitioned among tenants.
- **Database Partitioning:** The `tenant_id` is integrated into the primary key in Cassandra, ensuring that each tenant's data remains isolated.

Implementation highlights:
```python
def process_chunk(message):
    """Process a chunk of LAS data with tenant isolation"""
    tenant_id = message.get('tenant_id')
    file_name = message.get('file_name')
    points = message.get('points', [])
    
    # Generate a unique file ID for proper tracking per tenant
    file_id = uuid.uuid5(uuid.NAMESPACE_DNS, f"{tenant_id}:{file_name}")
    
    # Process points, applying tenant-specific transformations as needed
    # Data is then batched and inserted into Cassandra
    # ...

    # Logging and monitoring are performed to track processing performance
```

This design ensures efficient and scalable real-time data ingestion while maintaining strict tenant isolation across all processing stages.

### 2. Streaming Ingestion Manager:

The streaming ingestion manager is implemented in `las_consumer.py` and is responsible for orchestrating real-time data processing from Kafka. Its architecture includes:

- **Consumer Group Management:** Leverages Kafka consumer groups to balance load across multiple instances (ZooKeeper is used internally by Kafka but is not explicitly managed here).
- **Parallel Processing:** Uses multiple threads to separately handle LAS data chunks and metadata, ensuring efficient processing.
- **Thread Coordination:** A main thread initiates and monitors worker threads (set as daemons) for continuous operation.

Key implementation snippet:
```python
def main():
    # Initialize and start the consumer threads for data chunks and metadata
    chunk_thread = threading.Thread(target=run_chunk_consumer)
    metadata_thread = threading.Thread(target=run_metadata_consumer)
    
    chunk_thread.daemon = True
    metadata_thread.daemon = True
    
    chunk_thread.start()
    metadata_thread.start()
    
    # Main thread keeps running and monitors worker threads
    try:
        while chunk_thread.is_alive() or metadata_thread.is_alive():
            time.sleep(1)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("Shutting down streaming ingestion manager...")
```
This design enables horizontal scaling by adding additional consumer instances, with automatic work distribution through Kafka's built-in consumer balancing.

### 3. Performance Testing:

Test pipelines in the project validate the data wrangling capabilities by transforming raw LAS files into structured JSON messages. Key processing steps include:

- **Point Cloud Transformation:** Extracting and converting core dimensions (X, Y, Z, intensity, classification, point_source_id) from LAS files.
- **Batch Processing Optimization:** Dynamically adjusting batch sizes for efficient Cassandra writes.
- **Compression:** Employing GZIP to reduce message sizes for improved network transfer efficiency.

I performed tests with varying numbers of tenants (1 vs. 3) and files (1, 2, and 4). Average throughput (MB/s) results are shown below:

| Tenants / Files |   1   |   2   |   4   |
|-----------------|-------|-------|-------|
| 1 Tenant        |  1.83 |  1.63 |  1.54 |
| 3 Tenants       |  1.58 |  1.30 |  0.69 |

These results reflect the impact of variations in message size and point cloud complexity, demonstrating that the implemented optimizations effectively enhance overall system performance. You can notice the performace starts to decrease as number of simultaneous instances grow. Max throughput was 8.28 MB/s (4 Tenants * 3 files * 0.69MB/s).

### 4. Monitoring System:

The monitoring system uses a structured JSON reporting format that's logged to files:
```json
{
  "component": "consumer",
  "tenant_id": "tenantA",
  "timestamp": "2025-03-13T12:35:45Z",
  "metrics": {
    "messages_processed": 153,
    "processing_time_ms": 250,
    "throughput_mb_sec": 2.5,
    "error_rate": 0.02
  },
  "status": "healthy"
}
```

Components in the monitoring workflow:  
* Data Collection: Metrics captured during processing and written to log files  
* Aggregation: Stats can be compiled by tenant and time period  
* Reporting: JSON logs can be used for visualization and analysis  
* Alert Generation: Thresholds could be implemented to trigger notifications  

### 5. Performance Alerting:

The system implements only performance monitoring and does not currently take any action when detecting slow performance:

The system supports adding of the following performance monitoring features but they are not currently implemented:
* Throughput Monitoring: Alert when throughput falls below 1 MB/s  
* Error Rate Tracking: Notification could be implemented when errors exceed threshold
* Processing Time Analysis: Detect abnormal processing latency

Response actions are designed but not fully implemented:
* Dynamic Batch Sizing: Reduce batch size when performance degrades  
* Consumer Scaling: Add consumer instances for high load  
* Throttling: Implement back-pressure when system is overloaded  

```python
# Example of throttling implementation
if throughput < MIN_THROUGHPUT_THRESHOLD:
    # Reduce batch size temporarily
    batch_size = batch_size // 2
    log_alert(f"Performance degradation detected for {tenant_id}, reducing batch size")
```

## Part 3 - Integration and Extension

### 1. Integrated Architecture:

The project’s integrated logging and monitoring architecture spans all major ingestion components (batch and streaming) to provide real-time insights and historical analysis. The design is as follows:

```
+----------------------+      +------------------+      +----------------------+
| Application          | ---> | JSON Logging     | ---> | Log Analysis &       |
| Components (e.g.,    |      | System (tenant-  |      | Visualization Tools  |
| las_chunker.py,       |      | specific log     |      | (e.g., Python/pandas, |
| batch_ingest_manager.py, |   | files)           |      | ELK stack)           |
| las_consumer.py)      |      +------------------+      +----------------------+
+----------------------+               |                           |
       |                              v                           v
       |                      +------------------+      +----------------------+
       +--------------------> | Real-time        | ---> | Alert Generation     |
                              | Monitoring &     |      | (Threshold-based,    |
                              | Performance      |      | e.g., low throughput|
                              | Analysis         |      | or high error rates) |
                              +------------------+      +----------------------+
```

**Data Tracking Details:**

- **Error Tracking:**  
  Each operation logs critical details including `tenant_id`, component name, timestamp, and status. If errors occur, full stack traces are recorded and categorized, making it easy to pinpoint issues in LAS file processing or message transmission.

- **Performance Metrics:**  
  Logs contain key performance indicators such as throughput (MB/s), processing latency (seconds), and resource utilization. These are recorded both for batch (las_chunker.py) and streaming (las_consumer.py) processes, enabling per-tenant performance assessment.

- **Structured JSON:**  
  Every log entry is structured in JSON format. For example:
  
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-03-13T12:42:56Z",
  "tenant_id": "tenantA",
  "file_name": "sample_file.las",
  "file_size_mb": 30.0,
  "ingestion_time_sec": 16.83,
  "throughput_mb_sec": 1.78,
  "records_processed": 550000,
  "status": "success",
  "errors": []
}
```
Overall, this integrated architecture ensures that ingestion errors are tracked comprehensively and key performance metrics are continuously monitored, facilitating both real-time operational insights and long-term performance analysis

### 2. Multi-Sink Ingestion:

The project architecture supports delivering data to multiple storage systems simultaneously using several strategies:

- **Fan-out Pattern:**  
  A single Kafka producer can send the same message to multiple topics. Each topic is then consumed by a dedicated sink adapter, allowing integration with different databases or storage solutions (e.g., Cassandra, Elasticsearch, MongoDB), thereby achieving data redundancy and parallel processing.

- **Sink Adapter Layer:**  
  Storage operations are abstracted through a sink adapter interface. This design allows the core ingestion pipeline to remain unchanged while different adapters can be plugged in to route data to various sinks according to the tenant’s needs or architectural requirements.

- **Event Sourcing:**  
  Raw events are stored in a primary sink (e.g., a Kafka topic or log store) and can later be replayed to secondary sinks. This approach supports system recovery, auditing, and ensures that data is consistently available across multiple storage backends.

This multi-sink strategy enables flexible data distribution while maintaining consistency and scalability across storage systems.

### 3. Encrypted Data Ingestion:
To secure LiDAR data during ingestion and transformation, the project recommends employing a layered encryption approach:

- **Transport Encryption:**  
  Use TLS to encrypt data in transit between the Kafka producer/consumer and between Cassandra client and server. This ensures that data packets cannot be intercepted or tampered with during transmission.

- **Message-Level Encryption:**  
  Encrypt the payload before serialization using tenant-specific keys. This protects sensitive data at the application level, ensuring that even if log files or messages are accessed, the actual LiDAR data remains encrypted.

- **Field-Level Encryption:**  
  For particularly sensitive attributes (e.g., precise geospatial coordinates), selectively encrypt specific fields. This adds another layer of security and complies with data privacy requirements.

This multi-layer encryption strategy minimizes exposure of sensitive data throughout the ingestion pipeline—from real-time messaging to persistent storage.

### 4. Data Quality Control:
To ensure ingestion of only high-quality data, the following measures are proposed:

- **Schema Validation:**  
  Validate incoming messages against a predefined JSON Schema before processing, ensuring that all required fields (e.g., X, Y, Z, intensity, classification, point_source_id) are present and correctly typed.

- **Range Checks:**  
  Implement bounds checking for numerical values (such as coordinates and intensity). Data points with values outside realistic physical limits are flagged and excluded from processing.

- **Completeness Checks:**  
  Verify that each LAS file or message contains all essential dimensions. Incomplete data entries are marked for review and can be discarded or sent for reprocessing.

- **Statistical Outlier Detection:**  
  Use techniques (e.g., standard deviation or percentile analysis) to detect and flag points that deviate significantly from typical values, aiding in the identification of corrupted or anomalous data.

- **Automated Quality Alerts:**  
  Integrate quality control metrics into the logging system to trigger alerts when data quality issues (such as a high rate of missing fields or outlier values) are detected, enabling timely corrective actions.

These modifications would help maintain high data integrity through the ingestion pipeline.

### 5. Multiple Ingestion Pipelines:
The design is modular and can be extended to support different workload requirements by:

- **Dynamic Configuration:**  
  Allow tenants to specify parameters (e.g., chunk size, batch size, transformation rules) via configuration files, so each pipeline can be tuned for its data volume and processing complexity.

- **Pipeline Isolation:**  
  Run critical or resource-intensive pipelines in dedicated processes or threads to ensure that heavy workloads do not impact the performance of other pipelines.

This flexible approach ensures that the platform can accommodate diverse workload requirements while maintaining scalability and performance.
